# simple-qr

I was just messing around with [qrcode.vue](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrcode.vue) and built this little tool.

## Project setup

```sh
npm i
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```sh
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```sh
npm run build
```
